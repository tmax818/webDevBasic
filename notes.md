- [download](section3/boilerplate.html)

- from mdn [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#Anatomy_of_an_HTML_document):
    - <!DOCTYPE html> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype; that's all you really need to know.
    - <html></html>: The <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.
    - <head></head>: The <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in the [next article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML) in the series.
